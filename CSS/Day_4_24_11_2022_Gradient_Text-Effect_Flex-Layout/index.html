            Birds have different sizes and can be as small as 2 inches and as big as 2.75 metres. For instance, bee
            hummingbird (smallest) and ostrich (largest). Birdâ€™s existence dates back to 160 million years ago.

            There are different types of birds that exist which vary in characteristics. For instance, there are
            penguins that cannot fly. Further, there are birds that are known for their intelligence like Parrots and
            Corvidae.

            Moreover, we have peacocks which are beautiful and symbolize rain and good weather. Next, there are bats and
            vultures as well. Birds connect very closely to the environment and are quite intuitive.
